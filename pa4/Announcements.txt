ANNOUNCEMENT 1: https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/135130/discussion_topics/519052
 1. Please use integer arrays when exchanging messages between server 
    and client. Do not encode or decode the integer arrays to chars 
    or other data types. For all types of requests, the request is 
    always an integer array of size 28 (REQUEST_MSG_SIZE).  For 
    responses, GET_AZLIST uses an integer array of size 28 
    (LONG_RESPONSE_MSG_SIZE), and the other requests use an integer 
    array of size 3 (RESPONSE_MSG_SIZE). For example, let’s say you 
    have request[REQUEST_MSG_SIZE] and  response[LONG_RESPONSE_MSG_SIZE].  
    You can simply call the following functions for sending the request, 
    and receiving the response.

    write(socket_file_descriptor, request, sizeof(int) * REQUEST_MSG_SIZE)
    read(socket_file_descriptor, response, sizeof(int) * LONG_RESPONSE_MSG_SIZE)

 2. PA4_client.zip and PA4_server.zip have been updated. You can download 
    again or modify the following changes by yourself.

 • [Line46 of client.c] createLogFile(MapperID) -> createLogFile()
 • [protocol.h for both client and server] LONG_RESPONSE_MSG_SIZE 29 -> 28

 3. Please find the attached Q&A that students asked about PA4 for 
    clarifications. I will share further Q&A next week.

ANNOUNCEMENT 2: https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/135130/discussion_topics/524083

There are a few other announcements and Q&A2 has been attached here. 

 1. If you have compile error, please add the following two lines at the 
    top of the source codes.

     #define _BSD_SOURCE
     #define _DEFAULT_SOURCE

 2. The data of the response in the case of RSP_NOK has not been clearly 
    stated in the writeup, so you can fill the response data either with zeros 
    or the data which is supposed to be returned in the case of RSP_OK. We 
    will check only the response code, won't check the data in the case of 
    RSP_NOK.

 3. There is a typo in Expected Output: GET_AZLIST of the PA4_Appendix.

[Mapper ID] GET_AZLIST 0 0 <26 numbers> should be: 
[Mapper ID] GET_AZLIST 0 <26 numbers>
